# nova-study

Implementation of [Nova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370.pdf) using [arkworks-rs](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/) just for learning purposes.

> Warning: Implementation from scratch to learn the internals of Nova. Do not use in production.

This repo is an ongoing implementation, the code will be dirty for a while and not optimized and not to be used but just to understand and experiment with the internals of the scheme and try experimental combinations.

Thanks to [levs57](https://twitter.com/levs57) for clarifications on the Nova folding.
